Cyber Vulnernability Manager

## Overview

**VulnTrack** is a Python-based application designed to manage and track cybersecurity vulnerabilities. 

The project helps users view vulnerability details, manage status updates, and add comments or reviews on the vulnerabilities being tracked. This project also incorporates real-world CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), making it practical for cybersecurity research and education.

## Features

- View vulnerability details including description, status, severity, and comments.
- Update the status of vulnerabilities (e.g., "Active", "Mitigated", "Unpatched").
- Add comments or notes for specific vulnerabilities.
- Preloaded with real-world vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, Buffer Overflow) and relevant CVEs from 2024.

## Example Vulnerabilities

- **SQL Injection**: A high-severity vulnerability allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A medium-severity vulnerability that lets attackers inject malicious scripts.
- **Buffer Overflow**: A critical vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **CVE-2014-123456**: A critical remote code execution vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server.
- **CVE-2014-456132**: A high-severity privilege escalation in the Linux kernel.
